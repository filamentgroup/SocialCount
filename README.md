The problems with social networking widgets are [well documented][zurb]. They're heavy and slow to load especially on high-latency mobile connections.

SocialCount is a small jQuery plugin for progressively enhanced, lazy loaded, mobile friendly social networking widgets.

 * Currently supports Facebook, Twitter, VK.com and Google Plus.
 * **2.98KB** (without icons, after Min+GZipâ€”compared to 309KB up front empty-cache pageload cost for Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus widgets)
 * 1 JS request, 1 CSS request, 1 optional request for icons, 1 optional AJAX request for counts (compared to 25 total requests for Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus widgets)
 * Easy to fit in with existing page design
 * Ability to share without JavaScript or before JavaScript has loaded.
 * Works with mouse, touchscreen, or keyboard.
	 * Mouse: On hover, loads a social network's native widget so that the user can Like/Recommend/+1 without leaving the current page.
	 * Touch screen: simple redirects to dedicated network share pages.
	 * Keyboard: Concise tab order.
 * Option to conditionally display count if it's above a minimum threshold. Avoid goose egg ghost-town.
 * Intelligent client-side caching so that two or more widgets with the same share URL only make one AJAX request.
 * Requires jQuery 1.6+

## [SocialCount Demo][demourl]

## Getting Started

The following archive contains both minified (`socialcount.min.js`+`socialcount.min.css`) and unminified (`socialcount.js`+`socialcount.css`) versions of the JS and CSS required to use SocialCount.

By default, the social networking icons are not included. However, SocialCount publishes a version that does include the social networking icons: Use the regular `socialcount.js` with `socialcount-with-icons.css` or `socialcount-with-icons.min.css` and the included SD and HD image sprites.

The archive also contains the **optional** PHP service files for the AJAX request to retrieve the share counts (requires PHP 5 with curl). To enable this feature for your widget, use `<ul class="socialcount" data-counts="true">`.

Vk.com examples work only on localhost.com because it depends on the domain. (you can create this alias for localhost in your hosts file). You'll need to add `data-vp-api="YOUR_SITE_API_ID"` to ul for vk.com likes to work.
